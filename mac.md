## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Version control system.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git an open source tool that developers install locally while GitHub is an online service that developers use Git to connect to.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
It isolates your work from the main branch so in case you make a mistake, it isn't permanent.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
The pull request pulls the repository from the online database to your local database.

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
The Switch command easily switches between branches.

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
Git fetch-retrieves data from original repository but doesn't do any filing transfer.
git merge-merges two branches together again.
git pull-retrieves data from original repository and copies any changes from the original repository to local repo.

7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when Git is unable to automatically resolve the differences between two branches.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Git will highlight the discrepancy and ask you which code to keep. You simply pick which code Git should keep.

Another way is to open up the file and making any neccessary changes.
